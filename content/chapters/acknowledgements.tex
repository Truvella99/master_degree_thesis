\section*{Acknowledgements}

Rethinking the path taken in recent years, as well as all the people who have
helped to make it such, makes me very excited and leaves me speechless. If I am
I got here, not only to myself, but also to all these people.
Thank you for this my rapporteur, Prof. Maurizio Morisio, for his
availability and its support during this course of writing the thesis.
I thank my parents, Gaetano and Maria, for all the sacrifices they have made,
have allowed us to get where we are now. Without their help I would certainly not
here now.
I thank my colleagues and now friends Gaetano,Alessandro and Mario. Together we have
shared most of the study days, and thank them for making it less
tiresome, and certainly more fun, between a laugh and the other. Together we shared
all the effort and difficulties typical of this course, and we managed to overcome them together.
I thank all of you with whom I have shared a part of myself and my journey.
