\section*{Acknowledgements}

Thinking about the journey I have made in those years, as well as all the people who helped make it so, makes me very excited and leaves me speechless. If I got here, besides myself, I owe it to all these people.
\newline\newline \noindent I thank my supervisor, Prof. Maurizio Morisio, for his availability and his support during the internship and thesis.
\newline\newline \noindent I thank my parents, Gaetano and Maria, for all the sacrifices they have made, and that allowed me to get where I am. Without their help I would certainly not be here now.
\newline\newline \noindent Even if not involved with university and actual projects, I would like to thank my closest friend for their precious company: Vincenzo Petrillo, childhood friend of a lifetime, but also Alberto Contaldi for his madness and Giuseppe Romano.

\newline\newline \noindent I thank my colleagues and friends:

    \item Gaetano, also known as Tanucc/TanoDev, for all the laughs and moments of study and fun shared together. 
    \item Alessandro, also known as the Regal Queen, for his regal presence during many moments of study and fun, and all the laughs shared together.
    \item Davide, also known as DaveBreaks, for the many moments of fun shared together (not of study since he tortured me with the grammar and the padding, but I still love him).
    \item I would also like to thank Giorgio and Giuseppe (also known as LoHacker) for their company and the many laughs shared together.
\end{itemize}

\noindent Together we shared most of the study days, and I thank them for making it less strenuous, and certainly more fun, between one laugh and the other. We also shared all the effort and difficulties of this course, and we managed to overcome them together. 
\newline\newline \noindent I thank all of you with whom I have shared a part of myself and my journey.
